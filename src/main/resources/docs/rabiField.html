<p>The Larmor precession panel allows the user to apply a magnetic field to the qubit and view the evolution
of the qubit state.</p>

The Rabi Field tab allows the user to see how the state of qubit is affected by two magnetic
fields. The one rotates around the z-axis, on the x-y plane pointing towards the origin, and
the second is a field the magnetic field along the z-axis that points from toward to the origin
from Z+. There are three sliders on the tab when selecting the Rabi Field. Figure 3.17
shows the control tab on the simulator. The first slider is the B<sub>z</sub> value which is the strength
of the magnetic field that is along the z-axis. Adjusting this from low to high will make
the qubit rotate around the z-axis at a faster pace. The second slider controls the strength
of the perpendicular magnetic field that is rotating around the z-axis, along the x-y plane.
Increasing the value of the slider will cause the qubit to rotate at a higher speed around
the rotating magnetic field. This can be difficult to see if the magnetic field is rotating at
a higher speed and also if the strength of the B<sub>z</sub> is high (relatively speaking). The final
slider controls the angular velocity (&omega;) for the B<sub>perp</sub> magnetic field around the z-axis. This
is measured in radians/second.
</p>
<p>There is a check box that allows the simulator to match the speed of the rotation of the
B<sub>perp</sub> to the Larmor frequency. This is the frequency at which the combined force of B<sub>perp</sub>
and B<sub>z</sub> are matched in such a way that the B<sub>z</sub> pushes the qubit around the z-axis at the
same speed of the B<sub>perp</sub> magnetic field causing it to "
ip" or move from the Z+ and Z- poles.
When the user checks this check box, the simulator will calculate the correct value of &omega; and
will change it correctly. If the B<sub>z</sub> value is changed, the &omega; value will be updated accordingly.
The last control does not affect the simulation of the Rabi Field, but it allows the user
to view the path of the qubit, affected by the two magnetic fields. When the user clicks on
the button "Show Trail", it will become depressed and the length of the trail, or previous
states of the qubit will be shown. Because of computing constraints, the trail is limited and 
will continually follow the path of the qubit.</p>

<p>To start the effects of the Rabi field, click on the "Start" button. This will apply the two
magnetic fields on only the visible qubits in the simulator. If the slider values are changed,
they will take effect immediately. One this to note is that the effect of the magnetic fields is
the change in the qubit from its original state. Changing the slider may cause the qubit(s)
to move in a sudden or jerky motion. This is the because the the calculation of the current
qubit state is the effect of the magnetic field with the spinor values applied from the start
time to the current time. If there are problems viewing the trail of the spinor, it may be
best to "hide" the trail of the qubit and then "show" it later after the spinor values have
been set.</p>

<p>Lastly, the probability that the qubit will "flip" from the north and south, along the
z-axis pole when matching &omega; to the Larmor frequency is greatest when the qubit starts at
the state of |1> or |0>. The simulator will assume that the starting state of the qubit is its
current state when the "Start" button is hit. If the Rabi Field simulation is stopped and
started multiple times, each time it is started, the simulator will assume that the original
state of the qubit is the last place that the Rabi Field stopped it. This means that the Rabi
field cannot be paused. Since the starting state affects the overall path of the qubit, the
qubit must be put at the original state to replay the same evolution.</p>
