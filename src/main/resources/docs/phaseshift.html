<h1>Phase Shift Operators</h1>
<p>The S and T operators are two operators that define a partial spin around the Z-axis. They are also known as the 
phase shift operators.  The S operator is defined as</p>
<p><img src="images/s_operator.png"/></p>
<p>and the T operator is defined as</p>
<p><img src="images/t_operator.png"/></p>
<p>We can make the angle of rotation appear explicitly if we redefine S and T using Euler's
relation. In that case</p>
<p><img src="images/s_euler_operator.png"/></p>
<p>and </p>
<p><img src="images/t_euler_operator.png"/></p>

<p>Using Euler's relation, we can conclude that the rotation for the Soperator of &pi; / 2 is</p>
<p><img src="images/s_euler_equation.png"/></p>
<p>and for the T operator with a rotation of &pi; \ 4 is</p>
<p><img src="images/t_euler_equation.png"/></p>
<p>These operators are unitary but not Hermitian.</p>
