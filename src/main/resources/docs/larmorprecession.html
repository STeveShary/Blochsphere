<p>The Larmor precession panel allows the user to apply a magnetic field to the qubit and view the evolution
of the qubit state.</p>

<p>
The Larmor precession allows the user to see how the state of a qubit is affected by a constant
magnetic field. The magnetic field in this simulator points from the origin, along the Z
axis, to Z+. The user has the ability to alter the field and view in real time the effects of
that field. The figure shows the tab that displayed on the simulator when the user selects
the "Larmor Precession" tab. There are four controls that are available. The first is the
magnetic force strength slider. This slider allows the user to slide the scale from 0.1 to 10
Teslas. As the strength of the magnetic field is increases, the angular velocity of the qubits
will increase.
The precession does not start until the user hits the "Start" button. At this point, the
effect of the constant magnetic field will be seen on the qubits. The user may continue to use
the slider to change the strength of the magnetic field. When the user is finished applying
the magnetic field to the qubits, the "Stop" button should be clicked. The stop button will
immediately end the effect of the Larmor precession, but will keep the qubits in their last
state. Clicking on the "Restart" button will bring the qubits back to their original state
when the precession was last started.
