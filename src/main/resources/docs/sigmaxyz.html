<h1>Combination of Sigma X,Y,Z Operator</h1>
<p>Since all Pauli matrices are both unitary and Hermitian, applying the operator twice on a
qubit (MM|&psi;>) will give back the original qubit, i.e., M<sup>2</sup> = I where M is either &sigma;<sub>x</sub>, &sigma;<sub>y</sub>, or
&sigma;<sub>z</sub>.
Another interesting property about the Pauli matrices involves their product. Taking
the product of &sigma;<sub>x</sub>, &sigma;<sub>y</sub>, and
&sigma;<sub>z</sub>, we get I (the identity operator) as seen below.</p>

<p>Below are the products of the different Pauli matricies:</p>

<p>The product of any two Pauli matrices is the third Pauli matrix multiplied by the phase
factor of i and -i. This does not change the probability distribution associated to the &alpha;
and &beta; values.</p>
