<p>The qubit panel allows the user to control the state of the qubit and also apply elementary operators on it.</p>

<h2>Selecting a qubit</h2>
To view and modify the state of qubit, select the tab on the left side of panel.  The image above 
shows the qubits one through ten.  To identify which qubit tab maps to the arrow in the bloch sphere, 
you will see that the control panel is surrounded by a different color for each qubit.  The color for
each qubit will map to that surrounding color.</p>

<h2>Hiding and showing qubits</h2>
<p>The simulator allows for multiple qubits to be displayed.  By default the application starts will all
of the qubits visible.  To hide all qubits, click on the "Hide All" button.  To show all qubits, click on the "Show all"
button.  Each qubit tab has a control to hide or display the qubit.  It is a check box in the lower center of the
qubit tab.  The check box is labelled "display".  If the box is checked then the qubit is visible.</p>

<h2>Changing the qubit value</h2>
<p>
When using the simulator, you have the ability to measure the current state of the qubit
(without destroying it)! You also have the ability to manipulate the state to see how an
operator, or series of operators will aect the state of the qubit. Figure above shows the
control panel.</p>

<p>There are three ways that the qubit state can be change: by manually typing in the theta 
and phi angles (in degrees), adjusting the slider values of the angles, or entering the 
&alpha; and &beta; values. Whenever the state of the qubit is modifed by using one control, 
it will update the values in the other controls. Changing the angle using the slider will 
update the text value of the angle and also the &alpha; and &beta; values. As stated before, 
one the ways to change the qubit state is to use the sliders on the qubit control panel. The 
theta value can vary from 0 to 180 degrees. The theta angle is the angle between the positive 
z axis or the j0i state and the qubit. When the user enters a new value and then changes the 
focus of the text field by hitting the tab key, or by using the mouse to change the focus by 
clicking on another component, the application will update the qubit state using the new angle
 to set the qubit state. If the user enters a value that is outside of the range of 0 to 180, 
 then the application will reset the value back to the previous value.  The user can also 
 change the phi angle. The phi angle is the angle between the positive x axis and the projections 
 of the qubit in the (x, y) plane. Phi varies between 0 to 360 degrees. Again, to change the 
values by manually entering the numeric value, the tab key must be hit, or transfer focus to 
another part of the application to have the value take effect.</p>

<p>The second method to change the qubit state is by using the sliders. A slider works by
having the user select the slider, by tabbing to it, or by clicking on it. The value can be
changed by dragging the slider marker left and right using the mouse, or by using the left
and right arrow keys to adjust the value by one increment. As the slider changes value, the
qubit state will be immediately modified and displayed on the Bloch sphere.
The third method to change the qubit value is by modifying the alpha and beta values of
the qubit. The alpha and beta fields can have complex numbers entered into either field. If
a field is left blank, the application will assume that it has a value of zero. When both values
have been changed in the two text fields, the value can be updated by pressing the "Update
Value" button. </p>

<p>Setting the qubit value through this control can be the most precise, but also
the most tricky. The simulator will adjust the value if it is not normalized. Remember that
the &alpha; and the &beta; values must adhere to the equation: |&alpha;|<sup>2</sup> + |&beta;|<sup>2</sup> = 1. 
Secondly, if a complex number is entered to the alpha value, it will be changed to a real number by multiplying
both the &alpha; and the &beta; values by the complex conjugate of &alpha;.</p>
