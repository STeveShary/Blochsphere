<h1>Sigma Z Operator</h1>
The last of the three Pauli matrices is the Z operator which is also Hermitian and unitary.
This is commonly referred to as the &sigma;<sub>z</sub> operator. On the Bloch sphere, it is equivalent to a
rotation around the z-axis by an angle of &pi;. The 2x2 matrix form of the operator is given
