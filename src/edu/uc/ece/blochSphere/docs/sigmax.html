<h1>This Sigma X Operator</h1>
The X operator is one of the three Pauli matrices. It is also known as the NOT operator because it 
is the |0> qubit to the |1> qubit and vice versa. It is Hermitian and unitary. It
is also referred to as the &sigma;<sub>x</sub> operator. On the Bloch sphere, it corresponds to a &pi; rotation
around the x-axis. Knowing its mapping, we can derive the operator from the sum of the
outer products that represent the matrix. The outer products

and

form the full expression of the &sigma;<sub>x</sub> operator as

This is Hermitian and can easily be checked</p>
