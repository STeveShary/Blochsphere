{"name":"Blochsphere","tagline":"Java Bloch Sphere Simulator","body":"### Welcome to the Bloch Sphere Simulator\r\nThis Java program was created at the University of Cincinnati by several students under the direction of Dr. Marc Cahay. The goal of the simulator is to visually describe the state of one or more quantum bits after using simple quantum operators or magnetic fields.  Quantum mechanics and quantum computation can be difficult to understand the goal of this simulator is to help facilitate an understanding of some of the basic changes.  If you are interested in using this simulator, head over to http://www.ece.uc.edu/~mcahay/blochsphere/ to use it.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in in expanding and tinkering with our work, then clone the repo and get started.\r\n\r\nThis project uses ant as the build tool and we encourage anyone to update it to maven or gradle.  The scripts should be easy enough and we hope that you will credit the following people for their work on this:\r\n\r\n* Dr. Marc Cahay\r\n* Stephen Shary\r\n* Nick Vatatumic\r\n* David Kesler\r\n* Brian Jauch\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
